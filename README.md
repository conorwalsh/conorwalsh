- [conorwalsh/EdgeOS-Throughput-Measurement-Tools](https://github.com/conorwalsh/EdgeOS-Throughput-Measurement-Tools) - Python scripts for measuring throughput on Ubiquiti routers (running EdgeOS)
- [conorwalsh/LEDPostBox](https://github.com/conorwalsh/LEDPostBox) - This project uses an Arduino Nano to add LEDs to a post box to alert the user to when there is post in the box
- [conorwalsh/Arduino-Speed-Time-Track](https://github.com/conorwalsh/Arduino-Speed-Time-Track) - This project is a track that toy cars can race down. An arduino records the speed and times of each car on each run. The Arduino then sends this information to a Windows Application which records the data and draws a speed time graph. The software also calculates the acceleration of the car. The Arduino uses four LDRs and the length of the car to calculate its speed and acceleration. The Arduino uses LDRs to sense the light levels above the track, when a car passes over the sensor the sensor senses that it has gone dark and the Arduino times how long it is dark for. The Arduino then calculates the speed by dividing the toy cars length by the time taken to give the speed in m/s.
- [conorwalsh/ArduinoPowerUnit](https://github.com/conorwalsh/ArduinoPowerUnit) - This project is a power unit for an Arduino Microcontroller. The unit is supplied power using a 9V wall adapter and a 9V battery. When AC power is available the unit draws power from the wall adapter, when there is a power cut the unit seamlessly switches to the battery as a power source and back when power is available. During a power cut an LED is lit to alert the user that mains power is not available. There is also an LED to warn the user when the batteries are low.
- [conorwalsh/SiteUp](https://github.com/conorwalsh/SiteUp) - SiteUp? is a php script and online control panel that sends an email if it can&#39;t reach a specified URL.
- [conorwalsh/SEM](https://github.com/conorwalsh/SEM) - SEM: Smart Environment Monitoring system is an Arduino and web based (PHP) system that monitors, records and analyses environmental metrics both inside and outside (using external service) of the room that the Arduino device is located in.
